### Oh hey there...

I am an IT professional that also likes to dabble in a bit of programming, as one should. Mainly enjoy programming in python and automating things with PowerShell

I have many abandoned repositories. None of them contain completed projects :)

Check out PSTools for a collection of useful PowerShell snippets/scripts.

Lil blog where I want to post writeups and tutorials for CTFs, sys admin things, or anything else I am interested in (It's dead af because I'm lazy)
